 GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   2                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
   3 
   4  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
   5  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   6  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   7 
   8                             Preamble
   9 
  10   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  11 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
  12 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
  13 
  14   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  15 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
  16 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
  17 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  18 software for all its users.
  19 
  20   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  21 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  22 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  23 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  24 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
  25 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
  26 
  27   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
  28 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
  29 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
  30 and/or modify the software.
  31 
  32   A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
  33 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
  34 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
  35 incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
  36 encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
  37 software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
  38 The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
  39 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
  40 source code to the public.
  41 
  42   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
  43 ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
  44 to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
  45 provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
  46 users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
  47 a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
  48 code of the modified version.
  49 
  50   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
  51 published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
  52 a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
  53 released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
  54 this license.
  55 
  56   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  57 modification follow.
  58 
  59                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  60 
  61   0. Definitions.
  62 
  63   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
  64 
  65   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  66 works, such as semiconductor masks.
  67 
  68   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  69 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
  70 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
  71 
  72   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  73 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  74 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  75 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  76 
  77   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  78 on the Program.
  79 
  80   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  81 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  82 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  83 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
  84 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  85 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
  86 
  87   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  88 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
  89 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  90 
  91   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  92 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  93 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  94 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
  95 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
  96 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
  97 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
  98 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
  99 
 100   1. Source Code.
 101 
 102   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 103 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 104 form of a work.
 105 
 106   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 107 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 108 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 109 is widely used among developers working in that language.
 110 
 111   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 112 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 113 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 114 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 115 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 116 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 117 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 118 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 119 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 120 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 121 
 122   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 123 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 124 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 125 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 126 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 127 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 128 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 129 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 130 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 131 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 132 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 133 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 134 
 135   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 136 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 137 Source.
 138 
 139   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 140 same work.
 141 
 142   2. Basic Permissions.
 143 
 144   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 145 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 146 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 147 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 148 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 149 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 150 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 151 
 152   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 153 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 154 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 155 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 156 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 157 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 158 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 159 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 160 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 161 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 162 
 163   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 164 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 165 makes it unnecessary.
 166 
 167   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 168 
 169   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 170 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 171 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 172 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 173 measures.
 174 
 175   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 176 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 177 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 178 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 179 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 180 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 181 technological measures.
 182 
 183   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 184 
 185   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 186 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 187 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 188 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 189 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 190 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 191 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 192 
 193   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 194 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 195 
 196   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 197 
 198   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 199 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 200 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 201 
 202     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
 203     it, and giving a relevant date.
 204 
 205     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
 206     released under this License and any conditions added under section
 207     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
 208     "keep intact all notices".
 209 
 210     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
 211     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
 212     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
 213     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
 214     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
 215     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
 216     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 217 
 218     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
 219     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
 220     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
 221     work need not make them do so.
 222 
 223   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 224 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 225 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 226 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 227 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 228 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 229 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 230 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 231 parts of the aggregate.
 232 
 233   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 234 
 235   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 236 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 237 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 238 in one of these ways:
 239 
 240     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
 241     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
 242     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
 243     customarily used for software interchange.
 244 
 245     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
 246     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
 247     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
 248     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
 249     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
 250     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
 251     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
 252     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
 253     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
 254     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
 255     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 256 
 257     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
 258     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
 259     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
 260     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
 261     with subsection 6b.
 262 
 263     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
 264     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
 265     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
 266     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
 267     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
 268     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
 269     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
 270     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
 271     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
 272     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
 273     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
 274     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 275 
 276     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
 277     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
 278     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
 279     charge under subsection 6d.
 280 
 281   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 282 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 283 included in conveying the object code work.
 284 
 285   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 286 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 287 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 288 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 289 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 290 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 291 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 292 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 293 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 294 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 295 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 296 the only significant mode of use of the product.
 297 
 298   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 299 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 300 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 301 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 302 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 303 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 304 modification has been made.
 305 
 306   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 307 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 308 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 309 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 310 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 311 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 312 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 313 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 314 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 315 been installed in ROM).
 316 
 317   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 318 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 319 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 320 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 321 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 322 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 323 protocols for communication across the network.
 324 
 325   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 326 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 327 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 328 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 329 unpacking, reading or copying.
 330 
 331   7. Additional Terms.
 332 
 333   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 334 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 335 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 336 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 337 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 338 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 339 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 340 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 341 
 342   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 343 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 344 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 345 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 346 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 347 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 348 
 349   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 350 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 351 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 352 
 353     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
 354     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 355 
 356     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
 357     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
 358     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 359 
 360     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
 361     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
 362     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 363 
 364     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
 365     authors of the material; or
 366 
 367     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
 368     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 369 
 370     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
 371     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
 372     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
 373     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
 374     those licensors and authors.
 375 
 376   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 377 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 378 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 379 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 380 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 381 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 382 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 383 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 384 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 385 
 386   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 387 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 388 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 389 where to find the applicable terms.
 390 
 391   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 392 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 393 the above requirements apply either way.
 394 
 395   8. Termination.
 396 
 397   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 398 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 399 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 400 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 401 paragraph of section 11).
 402 
 403   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 404 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 405 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 406 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 407 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 408 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 409 
 410   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 411 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 412 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 413 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 414 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 415 your receipt of the notice.
 416 
 417   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 418 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 419 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 420 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 421 material under section 10.
 422 
 423   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 424 
 425   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 426 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 427 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 428 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 429 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 430 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 431 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 432 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 433 
 434   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 435 
 436   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 437 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 438 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 439 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 440 
 441   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 442 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 443 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 444 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 445 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 446 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 447 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 448 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 449 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 450 
 451   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 452 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 453 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 454 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 455 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 456 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 457 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 458 
 459   11. Patents.
 460 
 461   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 462 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 463 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 464 
 465   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 466 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 467 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 468 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 469 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 470 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 471 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 472 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 473 this License.
 474 
 475   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 476 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 477 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 478 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 479 
 480   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 481 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 482 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 483 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 484 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 485 patent against the party.
 486 
 487   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 488 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 489 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 490 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 491 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 492 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 493 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 494 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 495 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 496 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 497 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 498 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 499 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 500 
 501   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 502 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 503 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 504 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 505 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 506 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 507 work and works based on it.
 508 
 509   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 510 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 511 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 512 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 513 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 514 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 515 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 516 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 517 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 518 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 519 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 520 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 521 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 522 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 523 
 524   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 525 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 526 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 527 
 528   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 529 
 530   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 531 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 532 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 533 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 534 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 535 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 536 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 537 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 538 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 539 
 540   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
 541 
 542   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
 543 Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
 544 interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
 545 supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
 546 Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
 547 from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
 548 means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
 549 shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
 550 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
 551 following paragraph.
 552 
 553   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 554 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 555 under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
 556 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 557 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 558 but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
 559 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 560 
 561   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 562 
 563   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 564 the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
 565 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 566 address new problems or concerns.
 567 
 568   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 569 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
 570 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 571 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 572 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 573 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 574 GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 575 by the Free Software Foundation.
 576 
 577   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 578 versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 579 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 580 to choose that version for the Program.
 581 
 582   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 583 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 584 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 585 later version.
 586 
 587   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 588 
 589   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 590 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 591 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 592 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 593 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 594 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 595 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 596 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 597 
 598   16. Limitation of Liability.
 599 
 600   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 601 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 602 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 603 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 604 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 605 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 606 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 607 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 608 SUCH DAMAGES.
 609 
 610   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 611 
 612   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
 613 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
 614 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
 615 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
 616 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
 617 copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 618 
 619                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 620 
 621             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 622 
 623   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 624 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 625 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 626 
 627   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 628 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 629 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 630 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 631 
 632     TRAINBLOCKS: It adds some signs for the advtrains mod.
 633     Copyright (C) 2018  maxx, gpcf
 634 
 635     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 636     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
 637     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 638     (at your option) any later version.
 639 
 640     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 641     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 642     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 643     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
 644 
 645     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
 646     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 647 
 648 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 649 
 650   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
 651 network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
 652 get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
 653 interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
 654 of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
 655 solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
 656 specific requirements.
 657 
 658   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 659 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
